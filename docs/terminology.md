# Terminology

In this memo we use the term _data port_ to designate network ports that are
used to carry actual experimental data. The interconnection of these ports forms
the _data network_. In a similar manner, we use the term _control port_ to
designate network or serial ports that are used to control the experiment and
the equipment. The interconnection of these ports forms the _control network_.
In other words, the data network carries traffic that would be observed in an
actual deployment while the control network carries all the traffic that is
linked to the fact that the operations are performed in a tested instead of on
an actual environment.
